# how it works
A template, in our case, an original & pure xliff file is used as a base to add our translations and export to a different xliff file.
Apart from a template, an easily editable file -like txt- that stores the translated text *line by line* is needed.

Translated text is added to the text of the template file line by line.
Then the resulting text is exported to a seperate xliff file.

# how to use
Though I have written some other functions that can be used, the only function that needed is *form_xliff*.
This one is implemented in the releases. Further features may be added in the future versions.

Just download the exe and open it, it will lead you.
However, you may find a "how to" video in future versions.
